        <h2 >How It Works!</h2>
        <div className={styles.surface}>
          <p className={styles.aboutText}>This project was built using several different technologies. The main framework this project is built around is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nextjs.org/" className={styles.link}>Next.js</a>. The reason Next.js was chosen, was that in order to ensure the fastest possible page load times it was decided that the landing pages users can share with the public needed to be statically generated. Because of Next.jsâ€™s built in support for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://reactjs.org/" className={styles.link}>React</a> and its ability to easily regenerate static pages, Next.js seemed to be the best fit for this project. In addition to Next.js, data for this project is stored in a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas" className={styles.link}>MongoDB Atlas</a> database. Lastly user authentication is implemented using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://auth0.com/" className={styles.link}>Auth0</a>. For more details feel free to check out this project's <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/theogainey" className={styles.link}>GitHub repository</a> for more on how it works</p>
